# BlackHole - Procedurally Generated Universe

## Description

This project is a quick experiment I've been working on using Processing and Java. The results have been above what I expected with such simple code, so I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

## Installation

I recommend using processing to open the sketch and running it that way, as you will get console feedback when you change the parameters.

If this is not possible, there is an executable in the releases tab.
